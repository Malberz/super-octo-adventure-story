Once upon a time there was a King named Samuel, who lived in a green castle.  All along the walls were vines and shrubberies, some which had appeared to have been growing for years now.

The green castle which the King lived in was situated next to another blue castle. That castle was home to a witch, who was once the King's wife.

The green castle was on the east side to the King's castle. In addition, there was a yellow castle on the west side of the King's blue castle, which belongs to the King's new wife, who was the guardian of the Kindom. This castle's yellow color comes from millions of sunflowers planted on baskets hanged on the wall.

One day a gray storm cloud hung over the King’s wife’s castle. It poured rain for weeks on end, drowning the sunflowers and turning everything to brown. This unnatural phenomenon must be due to the curse of the jealous witch. The king decided to go over to the witch’s blue castle and confront her.

Samuel decided that in order to restore balance to the force and return the colors of the nation, he would have to kill the witch.  An epic battle ensued, and the King ended the fight with a suplex over the castle wall and into the ocean, where the witch turned to ash, and the kingdom was saved.
